        <h3>Mission Statement</h3>
        <div class="reference_text">
            Counterfeit electronics are a prevailing supply chain issue, which have continued to become more widespread
            in recent years.
            Critical systems have long life cycles and diminishing manufacturing source issues, making them a prime
            target
            for economically motivated counterfeiters. Counterfeit electronics create risks and life-threating issues,
            especially
            when incorporated into such critical systems. Since most of the chips in the market today are not equipped
            with
            mechanisms to aid in counterfeit detection, physical inspection is the most relied upon approach. During
            physical
            inspection, defects related to the exterior, interior, and material composition are extracted from the
            component
            under test, and these anomalies are used to determine if it is counterfeit. Physical inspection does not
            rely
            on electrical functionality, making it widely applicable to the diverse range of electronic chips in the
            market
            (analog, digital, mixed signal, large, small, etc.)
            <br>
            <br>
            <a href="javascript:showMore()" id="read_more">Read More</a>
            <span class="more_text">
                There are many longstanding challenges associated with physical inspection. First and foremost, in
                order to evade detection
                counterfeiters evolve and improve their methods over time. This can result in new defects and/or
                changes
                in the frequency of the defects found in counterfeit parts. There are few (if any) initiatives aimed at
                tracking
                such changes, making it difficult to develop accurate assessment of risk. Second, counterfeit testing
                is
                typically performed by subject matter experts (SMEs), which is time consuming, results in
                inconsistent/subjective
                results, and is difficult to adapt. Automated approaches that could relieve these issues need to be
                developed.
                Third, there are a diverse set of counterfeit IC types within the supply chain, all of which have their
                own
                unique defects that require a gamut of expensive tests/equipment to detect. Any research that could
                reduce
                the time and cost associated with physical inspection would be an immense help.
                <br>
                <br> The main barrier towards overcoming the above challenges is a lack of data. Developing and
                improving counterfeit
                detection through physical inspection requires images and measurements from a variety of counterfeit
                ICs.
                In general, researchers in academia do not have access to the state-of-the-art equipment, counterfeit
                samples,
                and experience necessary to perform physical inspection on suspect parts. On the other hand, the test
                labs
                with access do not have the time, resources, and motivation to devote to exhaustive data collection.
                Our
                goal in developing this repository is to provide the community with access to such data. To this end,
                the
                team at UF/ FICS Research has spent countless hours collecting measurements and will continue to
                maintain
                Counterfeit-IC.org over the course of this NSF sponsored project. We hope that researchers will take
                advantage
                of this resource to push the boundaries of counterfeit research as well as to share their own data with
                the
                rest of the community.

            <li>
                <div>Although some of the counterfeit defects shown here may overlap with manufacturing and packaging
                    defects
                    (e.g., those related to reliability, yield, serviceability, and ship-product-quality-levels), this
                    website
                    is in no way meant to track such defects. Manufacturing and packaging defects are already well
                    documented
                    and such information is often kept proprietary (with good reason).</div>

            <li>
                <div>The appearance of any single counterfeit defect does not necessarily indicate that a component is
                    counterfeit.
                    Similarly, it is impossible to determine if any components have been modified maliciously or
                    nonmaliciously
                    either at the foundry or while in the supply chain. The Counterfeit-IC.org Management team cannot
                    and
